<p>Winnipeg () is the capital and biggest city of the Canadian district of Manitoba. It is centred on the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, near the longitudinal centre of The United States and Canada. As of 2021, Winnipeg had a city populace of 749,607 and an urban populace of 834,678, making it Canada&#39;s sixth-largest city and eighth-largest metropolitan area. The city is called after the neighboring Lake Winnipeg; the name originates from the Western Cree words for &#39;sloppy water&#39; &ndash;-- winipīī hk. The region was a trading centre for Aboriginal individuals long before the arrival of Europeans; it is the conventional region of the Anishinaabe (Ojibway), Ininew (Cree), Oji-Cree, Dene, and Dakota, and is the birth place of the M&eacute;tis Nation. French traders built the initial fort, Ft Rouge, on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Nest in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. Being far inland, the city&#39;s environment is extremely seasonal (continental) even by Canadian requirements, with ordinary January highs of around &minus;&amp; minus; 11 &amp; deg; C( 12 &amp; deg; F)and typical July highs of 26 &deg;&amp; deg; C(79 &amp; deg; F ). Called the &quot;Gateway to the West&quot;, Winnipeg is a train and transport center with a varied economic climate. This multicultural city hosts countless yearly festivals, consisting of the Festival du Voyageur, the Winnipeg Folk Celebration, allure Winnipeg Celebration, the Winnipeg Edge Theater Event, and Folklorama. Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American Games in 1967. It is home to numerous expert sports franchises, consisting of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian football), Winnipeg Jets (ice hockey), Manitoba Moose (ice hockey), Valour FC (football), Winnipeg Sea Bears (basketball), and the Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball).</p>
