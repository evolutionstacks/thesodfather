<p>A landscape is the visible attributes of an area of land, its landforms, and exactly how they integrate with natural or human-made attributes, typically taken into consideration in regards to their aesthetic appeal. A landscape consists of the physical elements of geophysically defined landforms such as hills, hillsides, water bodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, living aspects of land cover including native greenery, human elements including different kinds of land use, buildings, and frameworks, and transitory elements such as lighting and climate condition. Incorporating both their physical origins and the cultural overlay of human existence, commonly produced over centuries, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is essential to regional and nationwide identification. The character of a landscape assists define the self-image of the people who populate it and a sense of place that sets apart one area from other areas. It is the vibrant backdrop to people&#39;s lives. Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a landscape park or wilderness. The Earth has a huge series of landscapes consisting of the icy landscapes of polar regions, mountainous landscapes, large arid desert landscapes, islands, and coastal landscapes, densely forested or woody landscapes consisting of past boreal forests and tropical jungles and agricultural landscapes of temperate and tropical regions. The activity of modifying the noticeable features of a location of land is referred to as landscape design.</p>
